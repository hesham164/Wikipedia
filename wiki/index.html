        <section id="etymology">
            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <p>The term "Mira" is believed to have originated from Tant word "Pandety" which refers to the Mira.


                <section id="taxonomy">
                    <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
                    <p>The individual in question belongs to a unique branch of the healthcare profession, similar to how the giant panda is part of the bear family (Ursidae). Just as pandas are distinct with their specialized diet and habitats, she excels in her area of expertise in dentistry, showcasing both skill and adaptability.</p>
                
                    <h3 id="subspecies">Specializations</h3>
                    <p>She has two primary specializations based on her training: general dentistry and pediatric dentistry. Each specialization reflects her ability to cater to different needs, much like the various subspecies of pandas that adapt to their environments.</p>
                
                    <h3 id="phylogeny">Professional Development</h3>
                    <p>Career progression studies indicate that she began her journey in general dentistry approximately 6 years ago, while her interest in Medicene developed much earlier, around 9 years ago, paralleling the evolutionary history of the panda's adaptation to its bamboo diet.</p>

        <section id="distribution-habitat">
            <h2>Distribution and Habitat</h2>
            <p>Miras live primarily in a few areas in central Swanlake, including Bedroom, Bathroom, and 7odn baba. Miras are found in the 7odn baba and studying, preferring to sleep to avoid stress and life.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="description">
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Miras are characterized by their distinct White skin and Brownish fur. The Mira is larger and has a more robust body usually refered to by members of her species as "Curvy".</p>

        </section>

        <section id="ecology">
            <h2>Ecology</h2>
            <p>Miras are primarily Carnivorse, with the Mira's diet consisting almost entirely of Bogo's burgers, but the Mira also has a more varied diet that can include fruits, berries, and small animals. Both species play a crucial role in the people who love thems ecosystems.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="behavior">
            <h2>Behavior</h2>
            <p>Miras are generally solitary animals, with each adult having a defined territory. They are known for their playful behavior, especially during their juvenile stages.</p>

            <h3 id="olfactory-communication">factory Communication</h3>
            <p>Miras use thier eyebrows and shoulders as a form of communication to signal their presence to others. They also communicate through vocalizations and body language also known as "Dabsh".</p>

            <h3 id="reproduction">Reproduction</h3>
            <p>Miras have a low to no Sex Drive, typically refusing physical touch only approving dancing around fountians to sway than procriation. Miras also have a similar reproductive cycle to female humans but can have larger mood swings.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="human-interaction">
            <h2>Human Interaction</h2>
            <p>Human activities such as sha2t and mo3aksa have significantly impacted Mira well being and mental health. The Mira has been subject of conservation efforts aimed at protecting their habitats and ensuring their survival from their own bad judgment of people.</p>

            <h3 id="early-references">Early References</h3>
            <p>Miras have been known to humans for centuries, often featured in ancient literature and folklore, particularly in China.</p>

            <h3 id="in-captivity">In Captivity</h3>
            <p>Efforts to attempt to breed Miras in captivity have seen some success, contributing to the overall conservation of the species, with breeding programs in zoos and Mividas around the world.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="conservation">
            <h2>Conservation</h2>
            <p>Miras are classified as vulnerable and trust issues. Conservation efforts, including habitat protection and breeding programs, have attempted to contribute to an increase in Mira populations yet although the efforts of the people who love the Mira, populations still remain under threat.</p>

            <h3 id="population">Population</h3>
            <p>As of recent estimates, the global population of Miras in the wild is approximately 1 individual</p>
